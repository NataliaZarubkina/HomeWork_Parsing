"Disneyland_HongKong",4,670623270,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.","United Arab Emirates","2019-4",41,"1","2024-08-11T13:16:20.089424Z",42697,4.282,"Positive","2024-08-11T13:16:20.089424Z"
"Disneyland_HongKong",4,670607911,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.","Australia","2019-4",42,"1","2024-08-11T13:16:22.584833Z",42698,1.669,"Positive","2024-08-11T13:16:22.584833Z"

"Disneyland_HongKong",3,670591897,"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.","Singapore","2019-4",44,"1","2024-08-11T13:16:53.158862Z",42700,26.19,"Negative","2024-08-11T13:16:53.158862Z"

"Disneyland_HongKong",3,670574142,"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery.

"Disneyland_HongKong",2,670571027,"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy.

"Disneyland_HongKong",5,670570869,"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover.

"Disneyland_HongKong",3,670022335,"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience).","United States","2019-4",60,"1","2024-08-11T13:18:41.414891Z",42716,1.383,"Negative","2024-08-11T13:18:41.414891Z"

The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure.

There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains!

"Disneyland_HongKong",4,668777351,"We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages.","Australia","2018-12",73,"1","2024-08-11T13:19:35.247733Z",42729,1.57,"Positive","2024-08-11T13:19:35.247733Z"
"Disneyland_HongKong",4,668611003,"Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.","Australia","2019-4",74,"1","2024-08-11T13:19:38.058929Z",42730,1.587,"Positive","2024-08-11T13:19:38.058929Z"
